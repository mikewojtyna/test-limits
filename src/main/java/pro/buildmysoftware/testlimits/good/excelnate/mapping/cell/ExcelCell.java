 * This annotation is a part of the Excel mapping system. One should use it to

 * This annotation is applicable only to simple fields, which can be created
 * directly from single Excel cell. The corresponding setter method (according
 * to Bean specification) is required to set the value of the field. By default,
 * mapping from cell to field assumes the type of the underlying field is
 * {@code String}. An instance of {@link ExcelCellMapper} can be provided to map
 * cell into arbitrary class.

	 * the desired cell value are indexed differently. For example: in

	 * <pre>

	 * 		sources = { &#64;ExcelSource(index = 0, source = "doc0"),

	 * documents. Note that {@code source} argument of {@link ExcelSource}
	 * is just a string label used to differentiate cell mapping for
	 * different documents. This label is passed to the row mapper, which is
	 * usually configured to work only with a single source document.
